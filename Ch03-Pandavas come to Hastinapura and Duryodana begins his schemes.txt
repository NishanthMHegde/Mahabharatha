The Pandavas spent their childhood near the Himalayas where they sported and played together along with their father. Around the same time, Gandhari gave birth to 100 sons. When each of the sons were born, there were evil omens which declared that their sons would be vice. They were also accompanied by sages who taught them religous practices, gave them education and taught them the Vedic scriptures.
However, after their father's death, the Pandavas had to return to Hastinapura which was their ancestral home. 
THe Pandavas were received with love by Bhishma and Vidura near the entrance of the city and accompanied them to the kingdom.
Dhrithrastra was happy to see the sons of Pandu who had grown up to be young capable adults. He was impressed by their virtues, knowledge and strength. He was particularly impressed by Yudishtira because of his virtue and adherance to Dharma. 

According to the religious principles and advice of the Kuru elders (Bhishma and Vidura), Dhrithrashtra crowned Yudishtira as the king. This did not go down well with Duryodhana. Duryodhana wanted himself to take over the reigns from his father. He stormed out of the hall in anger along with Dushyasana. 
Duryodhana and Dushyasana reached out to their uncle Shakuni to hatch a plan to dethrone the Pandavas. Shakuni was Gandhari's brother and he was angry on Bhishma for marrying his sister to a blind king. He decided to help the Kauravasas defeat the Pandavas.
Dhrithrashtra also had another son who was his 101st child and his name was Yuytusu. Yuyutsu did not have the same hatred as the kauravas towards the Pandavas and was neutral in nature. 
Shakuni and Duryodhana hatched a plan to weaken the Pandavas.
